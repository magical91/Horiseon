# Challege 1: Refactor Horiseon

This project includes the Horiseon coding refactored by yours truly. In this project you will find that the structure for HTML elements was improved with better semantics. The user will notice that "alt" attributes were added for accessability and better search engine optimization. Duplicate coding in the style sheet was simplified by creating group selectors. I made sure that every single link was fully functional and led to its corresponded intended location. Prior to a new element declaration in both the index.html and style.css I added comments to help maintain the readability for the future. Git commmits were added as frequently as possible.
